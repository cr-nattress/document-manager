### Dependencies & Critical Path

**Critical Path**:
```
Planning → Azure Setup → Backend Services → Backend APIs →
Frontend Components → Frontend Workflows → Integration →
Testing → Deployment
```

**Key Dependencies**:
1. Azure resources must be ready before backend development
2. API endpoints must be complete before frontend integration
3. Core workflows must work before advanced features
4. All features must be complete before UAT
5. UAT must pass before production deployment

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Azure provisioning delays | Medium | High | Start early, have fallback account |
| API performance issues | Medium | High | Load test early, optimize iteratively |
| Scope creep | High | High | Strict change control, prioritize MVP |
| Integration challenges | Medium | Medium | API-first design, mock services early |
| Resource availability | Medium | High | Cross-train team, document everything |
| Third-party service outages | Low | High | Build in retry logic, have fallbacks |
